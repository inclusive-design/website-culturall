<h1>Welcome to the CulturAll project website</h1>
<h2>
The CulturAll Network is a national, multi-sector network <br>
that develops innovative approaches, tools and strategies to <br>
ensure that everyone in Canada can participate in the Canadian <br>
cultural exchange. <br><br>
The CulturAll Network demonstrates how inclusive design becomes <br>
a naturally integrated component of Canadian cultural production.<br>
<br><br>
Together, the CulturAll partners have created inclusive <br>
film, live shows, online museum exhibits, web site tools, art <br>
installations, documentaries, television shows and sculpture. <br>
<br>
Learn more about our free accessible web tools, inclusive production tools,<br>
and techniques for inclusive cultural events here at our project web site or<br> by contacting any of the thirteen CulturAll partners. <br><br>
